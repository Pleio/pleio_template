Dat doen we graag samen met leraren. Zo weten we zeker dat we optimaal aansluiten bij jouw belevingswereld. Zowel in beeld als in terminologie en functionaliteiten. Daarom geven we 500 leraren de kans om als een profiel aan te maken, met elkaar in gesprek te gaan en samen met de ontwikkelaars de site te verbeteren. Dat doen we in een zogenaamde afgesloten bèta-omgeving. Mis je iets of werkt iets niet helemaal goed?
