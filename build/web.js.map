Daarom biedt Leraar.nl zoveel mogelijk informatie op maat. Ben je geïnteresseerd in professionele ontwikkeling? Wet- en regelgeving? In het basisonderwijs of in het mbo? Je maakt een profiel aan en geeft eenvoudig je onderwijssector en interesses aan. Zo krijg je een gepersonaliseerde tijdlijn aangeboden. Dat spaart tijd en brengt je sneller tot de kern.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"first-sm col-sm-5 col middle-sm\">\n                                <img src=\"/mod/pleio_template/src/images/campagne-op-maat.png\" className=\"campagne__image ___no-shadow ___margin-top-mobile\" />\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n\n                <div className=\"campagne__divider\"></div>\n\n                <section className=\"section\">\n                    <div className=\"container-fluid\">\n                        <div className=\"row\">\n                            <div className=\"col-sm-8 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-1 middle-sm\">\n                                <div className=\"campagne__justify\">\n                                    <h3 className=\"main__title ___less-margin-bottom\">Testversie</h3>\n                                    <p className=\"campagne__paragraph\">Op dit moment wordt Leraar.nl nog uitgebreid getest. Dat doen we graag samen met leraren. Zo weten we zeker dat we optimaal aansluiten bij jouw belevingswereld. Zowel in beeld als in terminologie en functionaliteiten. Daarom geven we 500 leraren de kans om als een profiel aan te maken, met elkaar in gesprek te gaan en samen met de ontwikkelaars de site te verbeteren. Dat doen we in een zogenaamde afgesloten bèta-omgeving. Mis je iets of werkt iets niet helemaal goed?
